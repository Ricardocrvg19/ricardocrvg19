### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<h3>
  My name is Ricardo. I have a background in Business Administration and I'm currently transitioning into a career as a Full Stack Developer.
</h3>
<br>
<h2>
In 2022, I had my first experience in the tech world when I took part in the domain migration of Perinatal to Rede Dâ€™Or. By the end of 2023, I discovered programming and quickly became passionate about the profession.

Since then, Iâ€™ve been fully dedicated to learning and growing in the field. Today, I build my own Full Stack projects using React and Node.js, and Iâ€™m truly enjoying every step of this journey of creating solutions through code!

Iâ€™ve also been applying many skills from my background in Business Administration to my development workflowâ€”such as a strong focus on results, business insight, and the ability to work with deadlines, goals, and under pressure, which have always been a part of my routine.

ðŸš€ Feel free to check out my projects here on GitHub, linkedin or reach out for a chat!
